Description: This is an updated first draft of my portfolio page that allows employers to learn a little bit about me, my interests and goals, and some examples of projects that I have built with embedded links. This was one of the very first projects that was assigned in my coding bootcamp. It was an excercise that not only prepares me to be employer competitive, but also to apply some of the learned concepts involving html and css.
